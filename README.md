Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com/edit/#!/codepath-site-light-and-sound-memory-game)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [X] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [X] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [X] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [X] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [X] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
N/A

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
I think the biggest challenge here was trying to connect the CSS and HTML portion of the code with the JavaScript portion of the code. 
It's really fascinating to me how the front-end and back-end of the code works with each other. I'm so used to coding back-end, the logic
behind the program, so this was really refreshing to program with HTML and CSS. It has always been hard for me to understand 
document.getElementById as that is one of the ways that the front-end code is linked to the back-end code. However, I think something that 
really helped for me was just playing around with the code more just to familiarize myself with how exactly the front-end and the back-end
code is connected to each other. 
3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
One of my biggest questions is how we use basic knowledge in HTML/CSS and Javascript and create a fully operating webpage with it like the
ones we see in when we search for something on Google. How does our work get published on the web and how do we maintain these websites once
they are made public on the web? What else will be needed/what should we learn to strengthen our skills in order to work towards a goal of 
creating sophisticated and professional data? How do we take user data from our web sites/pages we make and use them in our code if needed
(text data that might need to be parsed for statistical reasons)?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
If I had more time to work on this project, I would spend it on trying to make the CSS page nicer. I'm really interested in making things 
visually appealing. I think that's what really captivates an audience and I'm intrigued at how code can handle how a page is styled. If I
had more time, I would research more on advanced CSS styling techniques. I would love to create a splashpage for the game. So, before you 
go to the game and play it, you would have this separate page with only the start button and the title. I would want to make the splashpage
animated as well, perhaps add a transition in it. Additionally, after figuring out how to make a splashpage, I could make a popup page for
when the player wins or loses. Additionally add some pages to include instructions and perhaps a live demo.
